Open Science

A collection of tweets from the Weird Council conference, mined using the public search. 

This is a very simple set of scripts to mine the tweets stored from a Twitter search of the Weird Council
hashtag in September last year. 

The /data directory has the raw data which has been stored with all the metadata. 

The simple app is a Flask application which uses regular expressions to search for known parts of data. 

Its purpose is to show some ways in which networks can be seen in from the data.

Dependencies

Easy_install or pip if you do not already have Flask installed and Python 2.7.
